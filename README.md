Coding Challenge - Front End

 

Overview:

Write a CRA (create-react-app) application that allows searching movies from https://www.omdbapi.com/ and list results and then clicking on a film to show more details.

 

Data fetching Hook:

Use a custom useFetch hook to fetch data from the omdbapi.  [The API of the hook is up to you (parameters of the hook, and shape of the object returned by the hook), but all the data must come from it].

 

Navigation:

The application must use react-router or reach router.

 

Detailed view:

Clicking on a movie in the list of search results should show a detailed view of the movie on the right hand side of the page.

 

Other things we are looking for:

- The use of hooks and logic used to write the custom hook.

- A page refresh should display the same page (same list, same detailed movie)

- Routing - how the page renders when you click a link/search or refresh

- Forms - how data is handled from the input fields and then used to load data.

- Error handling - Handle input errors and error responses from the api.
